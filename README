Goal:
While there are several web based calculators for finding loan payment, nothing beats the simplicity, speed and efficiency of good old command-line! 
Typing up: 
pmt 25000 
is way faster than lauching browser, going to a website and finding your way around the GUI while ignoring all those annoying advertisements!

This simple program is implemented in Ruby and also can serve as an example ruby program while being a little more advanced than commonly known Hello World program! 

System Requirements: 
You need a Ruby interpreter to run this program. 
On Debian / Ubuntu run: 
sudo apt-get install ruby

Usage: 
./pmt <LoanAmt> [Rate] [LoanDurationMonth/Years] [TaxRate]
All parameters in [] are optional. LoanAmt is the only required parameter.
By default, duration is considered in years but you can specify in months by adding m at the end (Example: value 15 would be 15 years but 16m would be considered 16 months).

TaxRate is used for loan transactions where tax may be applied as a percentage of the loan amount. For instance, in the case of real estate purchase, typically property tax is payable as a percentage of purchase price of home. When a down payment is made, the house value considered would be different than the loan principal amount.

If the optional parameters are not supplied the following default values are taken:
Rate: 6%
Duration: 30 years
Tax Rate: 1%

Example: 
./pmt 450000 5.5 20 
This would calculate loan payment and tax on 450,000 (in your favorite currency) at 5.5% per year interest rate for a 20 year loan duration.
./pmt 450000 5.5 36m 2 
This would calculate the same loan for 36 months duration with 2% tax rate. 

Please feel free to send feedback, bug reports or enhancements.
